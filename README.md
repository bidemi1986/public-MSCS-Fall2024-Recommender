Project Proposal:
 
Movie Recommender System Using Machine Learning with AWS Deployment
 
Introduction:
 
Recommendation systems have become integral to many modern applications, helping users make personalized choices efficiently. For movie recommendations, these systems analyze user behavior and preferences to suggest content they are most likely to enjoy. The objective of this project is to develop a Movie Recommender System using machine learning techniques and deploy it on AWS (Amazon Web Services) to make it scalable and accessible.
 
 
 
Objectives:
 
The primary objective is to build a streamlit-based web application that recommends movies to users based on their preferences, leveraging content-based, collaborative filtering, and hybrid recommendation techniques. The system will be hosted on AWS, ensuring scalability and robustness for real-world usage.
 
Types of Recommendation Systems:
 
1. Content-Based Recommendations:
  - These systems recommend items based on the characteristics of the items and the userâ€™s past behavior.
  - Advantages: Personalized and less prone to the cold start problem for users.
  - Challenges: Over-specialization may limit diversity in recommendations.
 
2. Collaborative Filtering:
  - This approach recommends items based on interactions from similar users.
  - Advantages: Can suggest items beyond the user's immediate profile.
  - Challenges: Computational complexity due to large user-item matrices and struggles with cold start problems.
 
3. Hybrid Systems:
  - These systems combine both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.
  - Advantages: Helps balance limitations of both individual approaches, offering more diverse and accurate recommendations.
  - Challenges: More complex to implement and may require additional computational resources.
 
Proposed Workflow:
 
1. Data Collection:
  - Use a dataset such as MovieLens containing movie titles, genres, ratings, and user interactions.
 
2. Data Preprocessing:
  - Clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and use techniques like TF-IDF for generating movie embeddings.
 
3. Modeling:
  - Content-Based Approach: Build a model that generates movie embeddings using cosine similarity based on attributes like genre, director, and actors.
  - Collaborative Filtering: Use matrix factorization techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to recommend movies based on user ratings.
  - Hybrid Approach: Combine both models to produce a more comprehensive recommendation system.
 
4. Recommendation Engine:
  - Develop a streamlit-based web application that allows users to input their preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations in real-time.
 
5. Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the system using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.
  - Gather user feedback to further refine recommendations.
 
AWS Deployment:
 
To ensure scalability, security, and performance, the recommender system will be deployed on AWS using the following services:
 
1. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):
  - Purpose: EC2 provides a scalable and flexible environment to host the Streamlit application and the machine learning models.
  - Implementation: A virtual machine will be set up to install the Streamlit app and deploy the models. This offers full control over the instance and provides flexibility for scaling and configuring the environment.
 
2. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):
  - Purpose: S3 will be used to store datasets, model files, and any static assets required by the web application.
  - Implementation: The datasets and trained models will be uploaded to S3 for easy access and retrieval by the deployed application.
 
3. Amazon SageMaker:
  - Purpose: SageMaker will be used for training, fine-tuning, and deploying the machine learning models. SageMaker simplifies the process of training models at scale and deploying them as real-time endpoints.
  - Implementation: After training the recommendation models, they will be deployed via a SageMaker endpoint, which the Streamlit app can query to obtain real-time recommendations.
 
4. AWS Elastic Beanstalk:
  - Purpose: Elastic Beanstalk automates the deployment process of the Streamlit web app, allowing the application to scale automatically with traffic.
  - Implementation: The Streamlit code will be uploaded to Elastic Beanstalk, and AWS will handle deployment, load balancing, and scaling.
 
 
6. AWS Lambda (Optional):
  - Purpose: Lambda can be used to handle certain tasks like executing model predictions on-demand without managing the server infrastructure. This can be useful for processing specific user requests or performing lightweight computations.
  - Implementation: You can integrate AWS Lambda with API Gateway to handle model inference requests as serverless functions.
 
8. AWS CloudWatch:
  - Purpose: To monitor the health, performance, and logs of the Streamlit app and deployed models, AWS CloudWatch will provide real-time tracking of metrics and system health.
  - Implementation: CloudWatch will be set up to monitor traffic, errors, and performance metrics to optimize and troubleshoot the application as needed.
